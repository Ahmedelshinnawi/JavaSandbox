/*
Java Threads:
Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.

Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background
without interrupting the main program.

/*
Creating a Thread
There are two ways to create a thread.

It can be created by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method
 */
//public class Main extends  Thread{
//    public static int amount = 0;
//    public static void main(String[] args) {
//        // Running Threads
//        //If the class extends the Thread class, the thread can be run
//        // by creating an instance of the class and call its start() method:
//        Main thread = new Main();
//        thread.start();
//        System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
//
//        // Concurrency Problems
//        //Because threads run at the same time as other parts of the program, there is no way to know in which order the code will run. When the threads and main program are reading and writing the same variables, the values are unpredictable. The problems that result from this are called concurrency problems.
//        System.out.println(amount);
//        amount++;
//    }
//    public void run(){
//        System.out.println("This code is running in a Thread");
//        amount++;
//    }
//}

/*
Differences between "extending" and "implementing" Threads

The major difference is that when a class extends the Thread class, you cannot extend any other class,
but by implementing the Runnable interface, it is possible to extend from another class as well,
like: class MyClass extends OtherClass implements Runnable.
 */








// Another way to create a thread is to implement the Runnable interface:
// public class Main implements Runnable{
//    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // If the class implements the Runnable interface, the thread can be run by passing an instance of the class to a Thread object's constructor and then calling the thread's start() method:
//        Main obj = new Main();
//        Thread thread = new Thread(obj);
//        thread.start();
//        System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
//    }
//    public void run(){
//        System.out.println("This code is running in a Thread");
//    }
//}


/*
To avoid concurrency problems, it is best to share as few attributes between threads as possible. If attributes need to be shared, one possible solution is to use the isAlive() method of the thread to check whether the thread has finished running before using any attributes that the thread can change.

public class Main extends Thread {
    public static int amount = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main thread = new Main();
        thread.start();

        // Wait for the thread to finish
        while (thread.isAlive()){
            System.out.println("Waiting...");
        }

        // Update amount and print its value
        System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
        amount++;
        System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
